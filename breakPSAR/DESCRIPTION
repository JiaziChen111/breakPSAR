Description: A novel and fast methodology for simultaneous multiple structural break
       estimation and variable selection for piecewise stationary autoregressive (PSAR)
       processes. Modern penalized model selection is introduced for detecting multiple 
       structural breaks. It also simultaneously performs variable selection for each 
       autoregressive model and hence the order selection.
