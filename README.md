## Description
A novel and fast methodology for simultaneous multiple structural break
estimation and variable selection for piecewise stationary autoregressive (PSAR)
processes. Modern penalized model selection is introduced for detecting multiple 
structural breaks. It also simultaneously performs variable selection for each 
autoregressive model and hence the order selection.
