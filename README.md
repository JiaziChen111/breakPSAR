# breakPSAR
R package for A novel and Fast Multiple Structural Break Estimation for Nonstationary Time Series Models.

## Installation
devtools::install_github("liygCR/breakPSAR/breakPSAR")

## Description
A novel and fast methodology for simultaneous multiple structural break
estimation and variable selection for piecewise stationary autoregressive (PSAR)
processes. Modern penalized model selection is introduced for detecting multiple 
structural breaks. It also simultaneously performs variable selection for each 
autoregressive model and hence the order selection.
